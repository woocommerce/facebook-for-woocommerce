## Developers

We welcome your contributions. 🙌 Here are a few tips to help us work together:

- If you submit a new PR, please ensure the description explains why the change is needed, follows WordPress coding standards, is compatible with PHP 5.6, and contains a small changeset — PRs with massive changesets are likely to be rejected or asked for revisions, as they’re much harder to review for potential issues.
- If you’d like to propose a more substantial changeset, feel free to start a discussion of why and the proposed implementation in this issue! Giving our team a heads up increases the likelihood of changes being accepted quickly.
- Internet points are available for PRs that include test coverage! 🏆 💯 Especially failing + passing tests for bug fixes.
